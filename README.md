[~~Turns out light mode is better for the eyes
ðŸ¤¯~~](https://www.allaboutvision.com/digital-eye-strain/is-dark-mode-better-for-eyes/)

My eyes have never been strained when using dark mode, and darker themes not
only look better but are often more widely available.

Window manager: [Sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway)  
Terminal: [WezTerm](https://github.com/wez/wezterm)  
Shell: [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) + [Oh My Zsh!](https://ohmyz.sh/)  
Editor: [NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)  
Terminal multiplexer: [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)

## Setup

[Sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway) is a tilling Wayland compositor that can
be easily managed using only keyboard. Using it instead of desktop environment
has an advantage of not having mental overload of using `ALT+TAB` and mouse.

[WezTerm](https://github.com/wez/wezterm) is a GPU-accelerated terminal that
has great documentation and is configurable using Lua.

[Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) shell used together with [Oh My
Zsh!](https://ohmyz.sh/) has various quality of life improvements over
[bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) and in contrary to
[fish](https://fishshell.com/) is highly POSIX complaint.

[NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) is a fast and highly extensible
editor built on top of VIM. It's a definitely fun editor to use when you get a
hang of it.

[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) is a terminal multiplexer. Personally I
use it mainly for the following:

- session - previously I had to open multiple VSC editors for each project. Now
  switching between projects while using with `tmux-sessionizer` is a blast,
- windows and panes - new windows and panes under single shortcut,
- `tmux-continuum` and `tmux-resurrect` - all progress is saved and restored
  automatically.
